    <b style:"font-size:30%;" >Early Life</b>
    <p>She was born in Alabama in 1933. She was raised by a single mother. In her early life, she helped other Africian-Americans pass the Jim Crow voting test. Throughout her entire life, she has been dedicated to giving back to her community and helping others.</p>
    <p>
      School: She moved to Ohio and attended Xavier University hoping to get a pharmacy degree. She then moved to Cleveland planning to continue with her degree. 
      
      Unfortunately, the pharmacy program was shut down, so she switched to mathematics. She completed her degree while working at NASA.

      Career: In 1955, she began working in NACA’s Lewis Research Center. In 1958, Annie worked on one of the first-ever computer programs that enabled navigation in space. 
      This program was created for the Centaur project, but has been used in over 100 launches to get satellites and probes into space since the 1960s. 
      In the 1970s energy crisis, she created a computer program that measures solar winds. 

      Accomplishments and Contributions: Annie’s work with electric batteries laid the groundwork for the hybrid vehicles of today. 
      She researched alternative energy, co-wrote multiple papers about nuclear rocket engines and power plants, and worked in the launch vehicles division at NASA. 

      Death and Legacy: She tutored underprivileged kids during her free time and taught people about workplace discrimination.  
      She died in 2011, however she will forever be known as one of the first rocket scientists in America.

    <p>Annie Easley was a hard working, kind, and intelligent person.<q>My head is not in the sand. But my thing is, if I can’t work with you, I will work around you. I was not about to be [so] discouraged that I’d walk away. That may be a solution for some people, but it’s not mine.</q></p>
